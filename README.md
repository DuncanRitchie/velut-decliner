# Latin declensions for velut

Webpage that generates inflected forms of Latin nouns, adjectives, and adverbs.

If you’re not me (Duncan Ritchie), you’re unlikely to have much use for this page, since it’s designed specifically for my use-case. This webpage does not provide neat tables of declined forms organized by case/gender/number; please check a Latin grammar book or sites like Wiktionary if you want that.

If you’re interested in Latin vocabulary though, you should definitely take a look at [velut — my Latin vocabulary website](https://www.velut.co.uk). This webpage exists because I review all words before adding them to velut, and this process is made faster by generating forms using this webpage.

More details are in the “[About](https://velut-decliner.netlify.app/#about)” section of the page.
