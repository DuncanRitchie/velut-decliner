# Latin declensions for velut (obsolete)
[velut-decliner.netlify.app](https://velut-decliner.netlify.app)

Webpage that generates inflected forms of Latin nouns, adjectives, and adverbs.
Superseded by my [Inflector](https://github.com/DuncanRitchie/velut-inflector).

If you’re not me (Duncan Ritchie), you’re unlikely to have much use for this page, since it was designed specifically for my use-case.
This webpage does not provide neat tables of declined forms organized by case/gender/number; please check a Latin grammar book or sites like Wiktionary (or velut!) if you want that.

The Inflector is better because it can handle any part of speech, it reads from Json, and the input Json can have extra fields for custom behaviour.
It fits better into the architecture for [velut — my Latin vocabulary website](https://github.com/DuncanRitchie/velut).

If you’re interested in Latin vocabulary though, you should definitely take a look at velut (here’s the [velut website](https://www.velut.co.uk)).
This declensions webpage exists because I review all words before adding them to velut, and this process was made faster by generating forms using this webpage.
But now I use the Inflector.

More details are in the “[About](https://velut-decliner.netlify.app/#about)” section of the page.
